								<p>This project is a first person shooter made in Unity. </p>
								<p>The gameplay mechanics and features were made with C#. These include the AI's logic, player movement, gun mechanics, health systems and more.</p>
								<p>There are two maps for the player to use and there are three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. Each session is timed so the player can track how quickly they completed a level, their best scores are stored and displayed.</p>
								<p>There are many other things that go in to creating a game of this scope. A variety of programs were used to model meshes, create animations, adjust audio files and edit textures. I have also imported (licence friendly) assets to help with this.</p>
