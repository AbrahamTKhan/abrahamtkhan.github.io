								<p>This project is a 3D fighting game made with Unreal Engine for my university dissertation. </p>
								<p>Players can fight against AI enemies alone, duel other players, or team up with another player and take on multiple enemies. Fights can take place as duels with no respawns, or waves where enemies continuously respawn until all waves are cleared. The AI will adapt to the current context of the fight so players must always be prepared.</p>
								<p>C++ is the programming language that I’ve used for the development of the game. This involves core C++ functionality and Unreal Engine’s specific API that allows you to ‘communicate’ with the engine by exposing variables to the engine’s editor and create complex gameplay features. C++ powers the movement, AI, combos, hit interactions and many more features within the game.</p>
								<p>Whilst C++ was used to create the gameplay, there are many other things that go in to creating a game of this scope. A variety of programs were used to model meshes, create animations, adjust audio files and edit textures. I have also imported (licence friendly) assets to help with this.</p>
								<p>There are multiple maps and game modes available for the player to experience, including a tutorial.</p>
								<p>Source control and Jira were used to log the development of the project.</p>
